Research Goal:
1) Determine if there is hemisphere-dependent change in cortical and subcortical white matter (measured by d-MRI) in patients who recover motor function through brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy.

Functional Goals:
1) Convert raw DICOM scans (outputted by MRI) to SRC for tensor reconstruction 
2) Reconstruct diffusion tensor using GQI (model-free) technique in MATLAB
3) Correlate initial connectivity to change in motor function after therapy
  ## Note: Connectivity sampling script is not provided due to propietary nature
4) Build multivar lin reg model to predict change in motor function from initial connectivity 
5) Create scripts to plot figures for upcoming paper
  ## One script per figure - some data analysis included in each figure
