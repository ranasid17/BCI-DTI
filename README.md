Research Goal:
1) Determine if there is hemisphere-dependent change in cortical and subcortical white matter (measured by d-MRI) in patients who recover motor function through brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy.

Functional Goals:
1) Apply Q-Space Diffeomorphic Reconstruction(QSDR) to entire cohort so that reconstruction occurs in MNI space (rather than patient-space) which saves one step of processing
2) Divide brain into 4 quadrants (ipsilesional cortical, ipsilesional subcortical, contralesional cortical, contralesional subcortical) and run ROI and tractography-based significance testing for white matter changes due to BCI therapy. 
3) Run statistical testing on cerebellar ROIs and tracts in order to determine BCI impact on subcortical white matter reconstruction.
